>  Voltage is the electric potential difference, or the difference in electric potential between two points.
   It is measure in volts and the voltage symbol is V.
>  Current is the rate of flow of electric charge past a point or region.
   It is measured in amps and the current symbol is I.
>  Resistance is the measure of an object’s opposition to the flow of current. It is measured in ohms and the resistance symbol is R.

         /______\                 > V = IR
        /  I|R   \                > V/I = R
       /____|_____\               > V/R = I  

>  Series Circuits:
	-> The way to calculate total resistance in a series circuit is to just add up all of the resistances in the circuit.
	-> Voltage drops in a series circuit. Calculate using Ohm’s Law.

>  Parallel Circuits:
	-> Total resistance in a parallel circuit is 1/((1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3) + ... + (1/Rn)).
	-> Current drops in a parallel circuit. Calculate using Ohm’s Law.      

>  Voltage Divider:
	-> A circuit that produces an output voltage that is a fraction of the input voltage. 
	-> Voltage output of the divider = (Input voltage *R2)/(R1+R2)
		-> R2 is the resistor going to ground
		-> R1 is the resistor before the volatage output of the divider
