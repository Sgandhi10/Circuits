# Circuits_Circus

Our goal with this project is to help teach freshmen in an interactive manner the relationship between resistors, current, and
voltage in series and parrallel circuits as well as how a voltage divider works. Through this site we hope to make it both easier
and more feasible to teach how electronics that are used in every day items work.
